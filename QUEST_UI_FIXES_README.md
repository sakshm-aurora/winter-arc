# Quest UI Visibility Fixes

## Issues Fixed

✅ **Daily Attack showing monthly goals when not end of month**  
✅ **Weekly quests showing when not weekend**  
✅ **Battle Arena incorrectly locked**  
✅ **UI not respecting quest availability timing**  

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Quest Filtering

**File: `frontend/src/pages/Battles.jsx`**
- **Before**: Used `/quests` endpoint (shows ALL quests)
- **After**: Uses `/quests/available` endpoint (shows only time-appropriate quests)

```javascript
// OLD - Shows all quests regardless of timing
api.get('/quests')

// NEW - Shows only available quests for current time
api.get('/quests/available')
```

### 2. Battle Arena Unlocking

**File: `frontend/src/utils/featureLocks.js`**
- **Fixed**: Battle arena locking logic to properly detect active battles
- **Added**: Fallback logic for when battle data exists

**File: `frontend/src/pages/Battles.jsx`**
- **Added**: Proper `battleStats` prop to indicate active battle state

### 3. Enhanced Quest Attack Panel

**File: `frontend/src/components/RPG/BattleArena.jsx`**

**UI Improvements:**
- ✅ Changed title from "Daily Quests Attack" → "Available Quests Attack"
- ✅ Added explanatory text about quest availability timing
- ✅ Added empty state when no quests are available
- ✅ Better user guidance for quest creation

**Empty State Message:**
```
🕒 No Quests Available
Weekly quests appear on weekends (Sat-Sun)
Monthly quests appear during last 3 days of month
Daily quests are always available

Go to Quests page to create daily quests
```

## Quest Availability Rules

### Daily Quests
- **Visible**: Every day
- **Example**: Workout, Meditation, Reading

### Weekly Quests  
- **Visible**: Saturday and Sunday only
- **Example**: Weekly Planning, Reflection

### Monthly Quests
- **Visible**: Last 3 days of month only
- **Example**: Monthly Review, Goal Setting

## API Endpoints Used

### Quest Fetching
```
GET /quests/available?date=YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "date": "2024-01-20",
  "current_period": {
    "is_end_of_week": true,
    "is_end_of_month": false
  },
  "available_quests": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Daily Workout",
      "frequency": "daily",
      "availability": {
        "available": true,
        "reason": "Daily quest - always available"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_quests": 3,
  "available_count": 1
}
```

## User Experience Flow

3. **Hidden**: Weekly and monthly quests
4. **Message**: Clear explanation of when other quests appear

### Weekend (Saturday/Sunday)
1. User clicks "Available Quests Attack"  
2. **Sees**: Daily + weekly quests
3. **Hidden**: Monthly quests (unless also end of month)

### End of Month (Last 3 Days)

## Backend Integration

The frontend changes work seamlessly with the backend quest availability system:

- ✅ **Time-based filtering** handled server-side
- ✅ **Consistent availability logic** across all features
- ✅ **Real-time updates** as time periods change
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** with existing quest system

## Testing Results

**Frontend Build**: ✅ Successful compilation
**API Integration**: ✅ Proper endpoint usage
**Quest Filtering**: ✅ Shows only appropriate quest types
**Battle Arena**: ✅ No longer incorrectly locked
**Empty States**: ✅ Clear user guidance when no quests available

## Expected Behavior

**Monday Morning:**
- Click "Available Quests Attack" 
- See only daily quests
- Monthly goals NOT visible
- Clear message about when other quests appear

**Saturday Morning:**
- Click "Available Quests Attack"
- See daily + weekly quests  
- Perfect for weekend planning activities

**January 30th (End of Month):**
- Click "Available Quests Attack"
- See daily + monthly quests
- Time for monthly reviews and goal setting

The UI now perfectly matches the quest timing logic, ensuring users only see quests when they should be actionable! 🎯⚔️
